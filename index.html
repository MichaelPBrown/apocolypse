<h1 style="color:#66FCF1; text-align:center;">Intial Change</h1><br>
<p style="color:#C5C6C7; text-align:center;">From a fully functioning job to being layed off with 1200 dollars to live would be a huge jump.<br>I would be very hesitant to spend it, but in that event there are some things that are
necesities.<br>To start, I would purchase food, probably not a ton of fresh produce, but quite a bit of non perishables<br> to last a long time, I plan on living at home for college, because I am planning on a close one, so no rent,<br>
however, gas to get to the store and college if need be would also be in the budget. I would probably end up<br> paying for some of the house in some way eventually, so better leave some aside for that in anticipation.</p><br><br><br>
